# Codemixing Machine Translation

This repository explores **codemixing in machine translation** using the Google WMT24pp dataset and a codemixing dictionary.  
It provides resources, experiments, and results on codemixed data generation and translation quality.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview
- Construct codemixed datasets from WMT24pp using a codemixing dictionary
- Train and evaluate machine translation systems under codemixing conditions
- Compare results across language pairs

For step-by-step instructions on how to construct codemixing data out of google wmt24pp, see the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mN3aUPmxpjqoSOMW9xFRDY55QckjOdIe?usp=sharing).
